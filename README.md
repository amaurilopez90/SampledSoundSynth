# SeniorProject
Polyphonic Sampled Sound Synthesizer Project using a Raspberry Pi

# Abstract
In music production, being able to produce sounds originating from a wide variety of instruments as a strategy to attract the listener and to create pieces that would otherwise be played and recorded through live performance is very important. It allows the producer to write, or at least model, sections of music without needing the real instrument at hand or even the possible expertise required to play that particular instrument. By using pre-recorded digital samples to represent the sounds that would otherwise be produced through a live performance, and manipulating these samples to produce sounds of varying pitch, duration, and effect, the producer can essentially compose music exhibiting many different instruments and styles of play without ever having to play the instruments themselves. This project aims to recreate such a music synthesizer that uses sampled sounds as WAV files downloaded from the internet and wave manipulation algorithms to remodel these sounds to desired outputs, using a raspberry pi as the base computational platform and keys built onto a breadboard to model a launch pad for synthesis. 

# Dependencies
This project will be using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B as the main computational device, but will also be using a personal laptop for testing purposes. The software platform that the team decided to use for this project was Python 3. Some of the required packages and libraries required for functionality include:
- PyGame - Open source library that aids with the development of multimedia applications: http://www.pygame.org/news
- PySoundFile - Audio library used to read and write soundfiles: https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/
- NumPy - Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python: http://www.numpy.org/
